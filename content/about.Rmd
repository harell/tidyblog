<!-- # Foreword -->

I am a Senior Data Scientist with qualifications in Electronics Engineering and
Applied Statistics. In nither qualifications, I received good practices of
software engineering. As a result, many of my projects are haphazardly
structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle.
Realising my deficiencies, I embarked on a quest for good data science practices
in three domains: software engineering, statistical analysis, and project
management.

On project milestones, I look back and reflect on my craft. How have things
gone? How could I do things better? Developing a deeper understanding of the
data science domain and formulating concrete next steps give me pleasure.

This blog is part of my effort to document and communicate new findings and
insights. Rather than leading the audience after my blood trail, I try to write
in a clear and concise manner. I hope readers find those posts actionable and
impactful.
