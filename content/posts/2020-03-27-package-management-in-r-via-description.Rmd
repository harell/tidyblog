## Synopsis

**In This Post**

* Using a package manager that capitalises existing infrastructure. 
* Forming a discipline of grooming the DESCRIPTION file
* Managing R package dependencies in Docker.

## The DESCRIPTION File

Whether you are aware of it or not, your R application uses DESCRIPTION files.
This is because every R package must have one DESCRIPTION file that conforms
with the "Writing R extensions" protocol dictated by the R Core
Team[@team1999writing].
