source(file.path(path_root, "R/post_options.R"))
```

## Synopsis

**In This Post**

* Using a package manager that capitalises on existing infrastructure. 
* Forming a discipline of grooming the DESCRIPTION file
* Managing R package dependencies in Docker.

Who should read this post? Any person who needs a simple way to manager R
packages dependencies.

<!-- What makes the approach simple? familiarity and existing toolbox -->

The approach in a nutshell:

1. Maintaining package requirements in a `DESCRIPTION` file; and
2. Using `remotes::install_deps()` to install the required packages.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

* The [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package; and
* The [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/) package.

You can install them all at once by running:

```
install.packages(c("remotes", "usethis"))
```

## What is a DESCRIPTION File?

The DESCRIPTION is a file comprising metadata about a specific R package. Having
a DESCRIPTION file in a package root folder is a prerequisite for any R package.
The following is an excerpt of the
[ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/v3.2.1/DESCRIPTION)
DESCRIPTION file.

```
Package: ggplot2
Version: 3.2.1
Title: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
Description: A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics,
based on "The Grammar of Graphics". You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2'
how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use,
and it takes care of the details.
Authors@R: person("Hadley","Wickham", ,"hadley@rstudio.com",c("aut", "cre"))
Imports: 
digest,
grDevices,
grid,
gtable (>= 0.1.1),
lazyeval
```

DESCRIPTION uses an archaic file format called DCF (Debian control format) which
was available during R inception. DCF is somewhat similar to YAML in its
structure. Each line consists of a field name paired with one or more values
separated by a colon. When values span multiple lines, they need to be indented
by four spaces.

Different mechanisms in R are using different sections of the DESCRIPTION file.
For example, in RStudio under the package tab, the package name, description and
version correspond to the Package, Title and Version fields specified in the
DESCRIPTION file. The following figure is a snapshot from RStudio reporting the
above DESCRIPTION file content.


```{r ggplot2-metadata-in-RStudio}
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/gxuSNpZ.png')
```

## Declaring Package Dependencies 

The mechanism for checking and installing the required packages uses the
**Imports** field within the DESCRIPTION file. In the case of `ggplot2` (see
figure above), the requirements include `digest`, `grDevices`, `grid`, and
`gtable (>= 0.1.1) `. The parenthesis with the greater equal sign after `gtable`
specifies the package minimum version. In general, including the minimum
version is a good practice. This is because some bug fixes or new features
become available from a certain version and forward.

While you can, manage the DESCRIPTION file manually, two R packages mitigate the
workflow. Importantly, they reduce syntax errors and run without having the
DESCRIPTION file open.



```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval=FALSE}
pkgs <- c("usethis", "remotes")
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-source) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = "striped", 
    full_width = TRUE, 
    position = "left"
  )
```
