## Synopsis

**In This Post**

* Using a package manager that capitalises existing infrastructure. 
* Forming a discipline of grooming the DESCRIPTION file
* Managing R package dependencies in Docker.

## The DESCRIPTION File

Whether you are aware of it or not, your R application uses DESCRIPTION files.
This is because every R package must have one DESCRIPTION file that conforms
with the "Writing R extensions" protocol dictated by the R Core
Team[@team1999writing]. 

The following is a DESCRIPTION file excerpt of the
[`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/v3.3.0/DESCRIPTION)
package:

```
Package: ggplot2
Version: 3.3.0
Title: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
Description: A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics,
    based on "The Grammar of Graphics". You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2'
    how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use,
    and it takes care of the details.
