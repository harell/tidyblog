### Directions

#### Installing Package Requirements

Second, it is possible to direct R where to look for and install in R packages.
R starts up with one or more sensible default values, usually pointing at a user
library[^library] and a system library. In addition to system and user
libraries, consider an additional scope â€“ project library. Project library
comprises R packages which are not shared with other projects.

(optional) You can add a project library by running[^R_LIBS_PROJECT]:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(R_LIBS_PROJECT = "./cache")
.libPaths(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_PROJECT"))
```

You will also need to declare the project library in ... (Rproject?)

## References

[^library]: A library is a folder with a collection of installed R packages.
[^R_LIBS_PROJECT]: This command will consider a project subfolder named _cache_
where R packages will be looked for and installed in.
