The dependency of an R project on R packages makes both the R user and the R
developer lives difficult.

Making an R project work on a different computer requires the installation of
many R packages. This also holds when running an R project on the same computer
after a major R version upgrade.

On a granular level, an R project is dependent on functions within R packages.
One would assume that a newer version of a package would be backward compatible.
In practice, newer versions may remove functions and may contain changes that
lead to different outcomes. Thus, installing different packages versions than
those used during the development of the R project may lead to different
outcomes or an execution error.

Dependency management system for R help tracing, registering and installing
packages dependencies for a particular R project. Using dependency management is
essential for ensuring reproducible results and seamless collaboration within a
team of developers.

The dependency management system described here is simple and fits most
applications. It may serve as the bedrock of more sophisticated systems when
further needs arise.

# Overview

The approach in a nutshell:

1. Maintaining package requirements in a `DESCRIPTION` file; 
2. Setting the URL from which to pull the packages from via `options(repos =
"<MRAN-url>")`; and
3. Installing all required packages with `remotes::install_deps()`.

example.

# Managing R Packages via DESCRIPTION {#recipe}

## Getting Started

The dependency management system calls for three ingredients:

* The [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package;
* The [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/) package; and
* A `DESCRIPTION` file.

You can install both packages at once by running:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("remotes", "usethis"))
```

You can create a new `DESCRIPTION` file by running:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_description()
```

The last command saves a `DESCRIPTION` skeleton at the working directory with
the following content:

```
Package: project.name
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

`DESCRIPTION` uses an archaic file format called DCF (Debian control format)
which was available during R inception. DCF is somewhat similar to YAML in its
structure. Each line consists of a **field** name paired with one or more
**values** separated by a colon. When values span multiple lines, they need to
be indented by four spaces.

Package management in R is done primarily through assigning packages names to
the `Imports` field which we handle next.

## Grooming the DESCRIPTION file 

### Adding package requirements from CRAN

As the R application evolves, anytime an additional package is required for the
application to work, specify that packages in the `DESCRIPTION` file. You can
add a package to the `DESCRIPTION` file by running:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
```

Alternatively, you can declare the package name and minimum version by running:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr", min_version = "0.8.0")
```

The last command appends `dplyr (>= 0.8.0)` under `Imports` in `DESCRIPTION`:

```
Package: project.name
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports: 
    dplyr (>= 0.8.0)
```

`usethis::use_package` takes care of syntax, duplication and typos (both in
package name and version) for you.

### Adding package requirements outside CRAN

There are two good reasons why one may want to install packages outside CRAN:

1. A particular R package is not available in CRAN, but is available
somewhere else; and
2. A particular R package is available in CRAN, but a specific version is
required.

To install `dplyr` version 0.8.0, from GitHub rather than CRAN, we add it under
the `Remotes` field in the `DESCRIPTION` file. The remote dependencies specified
in Remotes should be described in the following form:

```
Remotes: 
    [type::]<Repository>
```

The `dplyr` package is available on GitHub under `tidyverse/dplyr` repository,
i.e. <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr>. Thus, in this case, *type = github*
and *Repository = tidyverse/dplyr*. The DESCRIPTION file becomes:

```
Package: project.name
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports: 
    dplyr (>= 0.8.0)
Remotes:
    github::tidyverse/dplyr
```

Without specifying more information, the dependency management system pulls
and installs the latest version available in the GitHub Repo (on the master
branch). Instead, we can define a specif git commit to pull and install:

* Installing a specific release: [`github::tidyverse/dplyr@v0.8.0`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/releases/tag/v0.8.0)
```
Remotes:
    github::tidyverse/dplyr@v0.8.0
```
* Installing a specific commit: [`github::tidyverse/dplyr@f05230dd`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/tree/f05230dd110a729e95b9ffb86df2030bf3b8b26b)
```
Remotes:
    github::tidyverse/dplyr@f05230dd
```

###	Removing packages requirements

Removing a package from the `DESCRIPTION` file is done manually. Open
`DESCRIPTION` and delete the package name from the `Imports` fields. Make sure
the last package in `Imports` doesn't end with a comma (',').

## Installing Package Requirements

### Installing package dependencies

# Putting Everything Together {#conclusion}

Putting it all together, we get:

```{r conclusion, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
###################################################################
## During project development use this code
###################################################################
# Installing a tool kit for convenience
install.packages(c("remotes", "usethis"))

## Initiating the DESCRIPTION file
usethis::use_description()

## Grooming the DESCRIPTION file
### add {ggplot2} as a requirement
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
### add {dplyr} version 0.8.0 and above as a requirement
usethis::use_package("dplyr", min_version = "0.8.0") 

###################################################################
## During project deployment use this code
###################################################################
## Emulating CRAN at a specific point in time
options(repos = "https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2020-03-27")
## Installing package dependencies
remotes::install_deps()
```
