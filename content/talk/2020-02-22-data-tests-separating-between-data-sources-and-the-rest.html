<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Data science projects in commercial companies often experience a challenge
arising from evolving data sources. As the project progresses, new signals and
information sources are added incrementally. In practice, when the data source
changes, it creates a need to change the application source code.</p>
<p>With <em>no design up front</em>, some application modules, such as a dashboard or a
machine learning model, unwittingly become dependent on the data source. In this
case, accommodating the evolving data source is not simply a matter of changing
the code related to the data source. Rather, preserving the rest of the existing
application in a working condition involves further code changes in distant
elements of the application.</p>
<p>An alternative way of dealing with evolving data sources is to introduce a
<em>small design up front</em>. Such design lets programmers manage the source code
dependencies throughout the project life-cycle.</p>
<p>This post suggests a design that (1) separates data sources from analytic
applications and (2) restricts analytic applications from knowing about the data
sources.</p>
<p>While the evolving data sources challenge is programming language agnostic, this
post demonstrates an implementation of the suggested design in R.</p>
