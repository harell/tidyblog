## Abstract

Data science projects in commercial companies often experience a challenge
arising from evolving data sources. As the project progresses, new signals and
information sources are added incrementally. In practice, when the data source
changes, it creates a need to change the application source code.

With **no design up front**, some application modules, such as a dashboard or a
machine learning model, unwittingly become dependent on the data source. In this
case, accommodating the evolving data source is not simply a matter of changing
the code related to the data source. Rather, preserving the rest of the existing
application in a working condition involves further code changes in distant
elements of the application.

An alternative way of dealing with evolving data sources is to introduce a
**small design up front**. Such design lets programmers manage the source code
dependencies throughout the project life-cycle.

This post suggests a design that <mark>(1) separates data sources from analytic
applications and (2) restricts analytic applications from knowing about the data
sources</mark>.

While the evolving data sources challenge is programming language agnostic, this
post demonstrates an implementation of the suggested design in R.

## Setup

### Meet Euel Cheatam the car salesman at Merceduce dealership

```{r} 
# merceduce dealership
# cheeky Euel Cheatam in action
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgflip.com/2qlpbb.jpg')
```

### The data

The first 6 car models from `datasets::mtcars` data source 

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    tibble::rownames_to_column("car_model") %>% 
    head() %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "available data during project inception", 
                 row.names = FALSE, digits = 0) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

## Developing a data-driven app without available data

The report includes a tidy data table, where each variable is a column and
each observation is a row.

### Make assumption triplets

Start by making **assumption triplets** about what information the user needs to
see:

* **Records**[^table-record] are car models; and
* **Target variable** is the price; and
* **Salient features** include gear, and mpg.

### Convert assumptions to assertions with data tests

```{r data-tests, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# 1. Check if the dataset exists
stopifnot(exist("cars_data"), is.data.frame(cars_data))
# 2. Check if the necessary columns exist
stopifnot(all(c("car_model", "price", "gear", "mpg") %in% colnames(cars_data)))
# 3. Check if the records are unique
is.distinct <- function(x) dplyr::n_distinct(x) == length(x)
stopifnot(is.distinct(mtcars$car_model))
```

## A system with no design up front

Direct connection between the data source and the analytic application

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# main.R
  
## Data Source: Local File
data(mtcars, package = "datasets")
cars <- 
  mtcars %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("car_model") %>% 
  tibbl
  
## Analytic Application: Booklet (report)
render_booklet <- function(data){
 boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data) 
 data %>% dplyr::select(car_model, mpg, gear) %>%  knitr::kable()
}
render_cars_report(mtcars)
```
