## Abstract

Data science projects in commercial companies often experience a challenge
arising from evolving data sources. As the project progresses, new signals and
information sources are added incrementally. In practice, when the data source
changes, it creates a need to change the application source code.

With *no design up front*, some application modules, such as a dashboard or a
machine learning model, unwittingly become dependent on the data source. In this
case, accommodating the evolving data source is not simply a matter of changing
the code related to the data source. Rather, preserving the rest of the existing
application in a working condition involves further code changes in distant
elements of the application.

An alternative way of dealing with evolving data sources is to introduce a
*small design up front*. Such design lets programmers manage the source code
dependencies throughout the project life-cycle.

This post suggests a design that (1) separates data sources from analytic
applications and (2) restricts analytic applications from knowing about the data
sources.

While the evolving data sources challenge is programming language agnostic, this
post demonstrates an implementation of the suggested design in R.
