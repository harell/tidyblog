@article{Kumar2015,
abstract = {Advanced analytics is a booming area in both industry and academia. Several projects aim to implement ML algorithms efficiently. But three key challenging and iterative practical tasks in using ML – feature engi-neering, algorithm selection, and parameter tuning, collectively called model selection – have largely been overlooked by the data management community even though these are often the most time-consuming tasks for analysts. To make the iterative process of model se-lection easier and faster, we envision a unifying abstract framework that acts a basis for a new class of analytics systems that we call model selection management sys-tems (MSMS). We discuss how time-tested ideas from database research offer new avenues to improve model selection, and outline how MSMS are a new frontier for interesting and impactful data management research.},
