## Abstract

Data science projects in commercial companies often experience a challenge
arising from evolving data sources. As the project progresses, new signals and
information sources are added incrementally. In practice, when the data source
changes, it creates a need to change the application source code.

With **no design up front**, some application modules, such as a dashboard or a
machine learning model, unwittingly become dependent on the data source. In this
case, accommodating the evolving data source is not simply a matter of changing
the code related to the data source. Rather, preserving the rest of the existing
application in a working condition involves further code changes in distant
elements of the application.

An alternative way of dealing with evolving data sources is to introduce a
**small design up front**. Such design lets programmers manage the source code
dependencies throughout the project life-cycle.

This post suggests a design that <mark>(1) separates data sources from analytic
applications and (2) restricts analytic applications from knowing about the data
sources</mark>.

While the evolving data sources challenge is programming language agnostic, this
post demonstrates an implementation of the suggested design in R.

## We are helping our clients by fitting a solution to their needs

### Getting to know our client 

Our client is Euel Cheatam the Merceduce dealership manager.

```{r Eual-during-mentorship-session} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/IcwSkWa.png')
```

Eual has been working in Mercedes dealership as a car salesman for the last 7
years. Today, Eual serves as the dealership manager. His main duty is to ensure
a profitable, complaint, and effective dealership.

- Eual **thinks** that a professional car salesperson needs to answer prospects
queries quickly and accurately.
- Eual **sees** that it takes new hires several months to master the
dealership’s car specifications. During these months new-hires convert fewer
prospects into clients; this causes new hires to get demotivated; which leads to
fewer sales -- it's a vicious cycle.
- Eual **feels** obligated to provide resources that will enable everyone to
succeed as a salesperson, regardless of their work tenure.
- Eual **does** not have enough free time slots in his calendar to accommodate
daily mentoring for all the dealership salespeople.

### The proposed solution is a weekly fact sheet with popular Q&A  

```{r car-stat-sheet} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/CMbZ8h7.png')
```

<!-- Position Statement -->

For the car salespeople who work at Mercedes dealership, the *Factcedes™* is a
weekly email service that provides a succinct and readable fact sheet with
popular Q&A about the dealership vehicles. Unlike water cooler talks, our
product has been carefully formulated and evaluated against veterans and is
distributed regularly.

### The developers encounter real-world impediments 

```{r 1st-world-problems} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/TAcOHZO.png')
```

Programmers encounter many 1^st^ world problems during the development process;
Unavailable database is one of them. A slow database is another.

## 1^st^ iteration: developing a data-driven app without real data

The report includes a tidy data table, where each variable is a column and
each observation is a row.

### Generate dataset assumption triplet

Start by making **assumption triplets** about what information the user needs to
see:

* **Primary Key** represents car models;
* **Target variable** is the price; and
* **Salient features** include gear, and mpg.

```{r tidy-table, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1238)
n <- 6
tibble::tibble(
    uid = head(1:26, n),
    x1 = head(letters, n),
    x2 = head(LETTERS, n),
    y = rpois(n, lambda = 5)
)
```

### Convert assumptions to assertions with data-tests

* Data-tests are assertions that ensure [data
integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity), mainly, they concern
the data existance and structure.
* Data tests are like clauses in a contract. 
* The analytic application dictates the clauses.
* The analytic application is dependent only on the clauses.

```{r data-tests, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# data-tests.R
## 1. Check if the dataset exists
stopifnot(exist("cars_data"), is.data.frame(cars_data))
  
## 2. Check if the necessary columns exist
expected_cols <- c("car_model", "price", "gear", "mpg")
stopifnot(all(expected_cols %in% colnames(cars_data)))
  
## 3. Check if the records are unique
is.distinct <- function(x) dplyr::n_distinct(x) == length(x)
stopifnot(is.distinct(cars_data$car_model))
```

### Implement data source plugins

#### Quick glimpse over the `mtcars` dataset

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    head() %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "The first 6 car models from `datasets::mtcars`", 
                 row.names = TRUE, digits = 0) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

#### Generate synthetic data[^synthetic-data] plugin

```{r data-source, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# data-source.R
rm(cars_data)

## 1. Generate records 
data(mtcars, package = "datasets")
cars_data <- mtcars %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("car_model")
  
## 2. Generate price
set.seed(2020)
price <- runif(n = nrow(cars_data), min = 41, max = 75)
cars_data <- cars_data %>% tibble::add_column(price = price)
  
## Run data-tests
source("data-tests.R")
```

### Develop analytic applications

```{r synthetic-data, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# app.R
## 1. Get the data
source("data-source.R")
  
## 2. Render booklet
print(cars_data %>% dplyr::select(car_model, mpg, gear, price))
boxplot(price ~ mpg + gear, cars_data)  
```

[^synthetic-data]: A synthetic datasetis contains data that is artificially
created rather than being generated by actual events.
