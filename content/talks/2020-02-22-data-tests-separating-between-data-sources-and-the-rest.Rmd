## Abstract

Data science projects in commercial companies often experience a challenge
arising from evolving data sources[^glossary-data-source]. As the project
progresses, new signals and information sources are added incrementally. In
practice, when the data source changes, it creates a need to change the
application source code.

With **no design up front**, some analytic modules[^glossary-analytic-module],
such as a dashboard or a machine learning model, unwittingly become dependent on
the data source. In this case, accommodating the evolving data source is not
simply a matter of changing the code related to the data source. Rather,
preserving the rest of the existing application in a working condition involves
further code changes in distant elements of the application.

An alternative way of dealing with evolving data sources is to introduce a
**small design up front**. Such design lets data scientists manage the source
code dependencies throughout the project life-cycle.

This post suggests a design that <mark>(1) separates data sources from analytic
applications and (2) restricts analytic modules from knowing about the data
sources</mark>.

While the evolving data sources challenge is programming language agnostic, this
post demonstrates an implementation of the suggested design in R.

## Helping our clients by fitting a solution to their needs

This talk features a confabulated story that covers real challenges. 

We work in an Agile environment and we cover the first iteration, going from
nothing to something.

### Getting to know our client 

Our client is Euel Cheatam the Merceduce dealership manager.

```{r Eual-during-mentorship-session} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/IcwSkWa.png')
```

Eual has been working in Mercedes dealership as a car salesman for the last 7
years. Today, Eual serves as the dealership manager. His main duty is to ensure
a profitable, complaint, and effective dealership.

- Eual **thinks** that a professional car salesperson needs to answer prospects
queries quickly and accurately.
- Eual **sees** that it takes new hires several months to master the
dealership’s cars specifications. During these months new-hires convert fewer
prospects into clients; this causes new hires to get demotivated; which leads to
fewer sales -- it's a vicious cycle.
- Eual **feels** obligated to provide resources that will enable everyone to
succeed as a salesperson, regardless of their work tenure.
- Eual **does** not have enough free time slots in his calendar to accommodate
daily mentoring for all the dealership salespeople.

### The proposed solution is a weekly fact sheet with popular Q&A  

```{r car-stat-sheet} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/CMbZ8h7.png')
```

<!-- Position Statement -->

For the car salespeople who work at Mercedes dealership, the *Factcedes™* is a
weekly email service that provides a succinct and readable fact sheet with
popular Q&A about the dealership vehicles. Unlike water cooler talks, our
product has been carefully formulated and evaluated against veterans and is
distributed regularly.

With the customer blessing and a firm handshake, we initiate product
development.

### Moving from ideation to implementation, data scientists encounter real-world impediments

```{r 1st-world-problems} 
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/TAcOHZO.png')
```

At this stage, the data scientists have a data-driven product in mind, but they
are facing two challenges:

1. Identifying the important information for the application; and
2. Getting access to the data.

The first challenge occurs because the data scientists don’t know what
information they need. Instead, they have assumptions about what information
could be relevant. As the project progress, exploration will lead them to new
findings and new data sources.

The second challenge occurs because of external factors such as personal or
policy regarding the data. The people responsible for the database could be
unavailable. Another impediment involves data security policy or something of
that sort. 

In any case, datasets are hard to obtain.

To mitigate what the real world imposes on us, we need a system design that can
handle changes.

## Iteration 0: developing a data-driven app without real data

In iteration zero we are going to move from no product to a product. Once we
have something, we can show it to the client and receive feedback at an early
stage of development.

### Generate dataset assumption triplet

<!-- Having an analytic application in mind, we can derive assumption about what data -->
<!-- is required. -->

In many cases, including the case in hand, the analytic module can be satisfied
with a tidy data table in its input.

A tidy data table [@wickham2016r, ch. 12] follows a consistent tabular format
where each variable is a column and each observation is a row.

```{r tidy-table, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1238)
n <- 6
tibble::tibble(
    uid = head(1:26, n),
    x1 = head(letters, n),
    x2 = head(LETTERS, n),
    y = rpois(n, lambda = 5)
)
```

The data scientist wants the tidy data table to support all of the necessary
variables required by the analytic module, but does not know what all those
variables are. However, the data scientist does know the basic intent of the
analytic app.

Start by making an **assumption triplet** about what information the user needs
to see. 

An assumption triplet comprises hypotheses about three variable types that
should be in the tidy data table: **Observation Unique Identifier (UID)**,
**Target variable** and **Salient features**.

In our example, 

* **Observation Unique Identifier (UID)** corresponds to car models;
* **Target variable** is the price; and
* **Salient features** include gear, and mpg.

<!-- tidy data table leaves heavy data wrangling tasks outside the
responsibility of the analytic module. -->

### Convert assumptions to assertions with data-tests

Having rudimentary assumptions about what the analytic module is likely to use,
we write down assertions in a new module called data-tests.

* The data tests module is a high-level policy. It contains no data.
* The data-tests module comprises assertions that ensure [data
integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity). Mainly, its assertions
concern the existence and structure of the data.
<!-- * The assertions within the data-tests module are like clauses in a contract. -->

```{r data-tests, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# data-tests.R
## 1. Check if the dataset exists
stopifnot(exist("cars_data"), is.data.frame(cars_data))
  
## 2. Check if the necessary columns exist
expected_cols <- c("car_model", "price", "gear", "mpg")
stopifnot(all(expected_cols %in% colnames(cars_data)))
  
## 3. Check if the records are unique
is.distinct <- function(x) dplyr::n_distinct(x) == length(x)
stopifnot(is.distinct(cars_data$car_model))
```

### Implement a data source plugin

#### Quick glimpse over the `mtcars` dataset

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    head() %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "The first 6 car models from `datasets::mtcars`", 
                 row.names = TRUE, digits = 0) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

#### Generate synthetic data[^synthetic-data] plugin

```{r data-access, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# data-access.R
get_cars_data <- function(){
  ## 1. Generate records 
  data(mtcars, package = "datasets")
  cars_data <- mtcars %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("car_model")
  
  ## 2. Generate price
  set.seed(2020)
  price <- runif(n = nrow(cars_data), min = 41, max = 75)
  cars_data <- cars_data %>% tibble::add_column(price = price)
  
  ## Run data-tests
  source("data-tests.R")
  return(cars_data)
}
```

Notice that without conforming to data-tests assertions, the data source does
not come into existence. That means the data source is dependent on data-tests.
Recall that the assertions in data-tests are dictated by the intent of the
analytic module. It is these assertions that know about the analytic module.

### Develop an analytic module

```{r synthetic-data, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# app.R
## 1. Get the data
source("data-source.R")
cars_data <- get_cars_data()
  
## 2. Render booklet
print(cars_data %>% dplyr::select(car_model, mpg, gear, price))
lm(mpg ~ hp, cars_data) %>% summary()
```

## Why and how we seperated the data source from the rest

### Recall why we have separated the data source from the rest

In short, change amplification and cognitive load.

Any analytic app has two essential parts: *data source* and *analytic
module*. Importantly, in many applications the data source is independent of the
analytic module, but the analytic module is dependent on the data source.

This type of relationship puts the data source at the center of the system. The
analytic modules revolve around the data source. They are plugins of the
data source.

#### Change amplification

The problem is that both the data source and the analytic module change throughout
the project life cycle. 

In data-centric configuration, changes in the data source propagate into the
analytic module.

#### Cognitive load

It is not obvious what data in the database is important for the app to run.
if one is asked to replace a data source with another implementation, it is not obvious what )


The database, its query language, and even its schema are technical details
that have nothing to do with the analytic module. They will change at
rates, and for reasons, that are independent of other aspects of the system.
Consequently, the data-tests separate the data source from the rest of the
system so that they can be independently changed.


The suggested system design:

(1) Divides and encapsulates those parts into modules; 
(2) Separates both parts by introducing an intermediate module dubbed
*data-tests*; and
(3) Dictates that both parts must depend on the data-tests module.  

The primary advantage of using data-tests is that <mark>the data source module
and the analytic module do not know anything of each other</mark>. This
allows those modules to evolve frequently and independently.

### Recall how we have separated the data source from the rest

First, we identified the variables which the analytic module may need.

Second, we make wrote down our assumptions in data-tests.

Third, we implemented a data source that conforms to the data-tests.

Finally, we developed our application module using only the available
information specified in data-tests.
