<!-- # Foreword {-} -->

I am a Senior Data Scientist with qualifications in Electronics Engineering and
Applied Statistics.

Neither of these qualifications have provided me with good practices of software
engineering. As a result, many of my data science projects were haphazardly
structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle.
Some projects were successful in producing the desired outcome. However, without
an appropriate software development approach in place, extending and maintaining
them required a substantial amount of time and effort.

Guided by an aspiration to minimise effort and maximise productivity, I embarked
on a quest for good data science practices in three domains: software
engineering, statistical analysis, and project management.

When reaching project milestones, I look back at my craft and reflect. What
approach/tool/technique worked well for the project? What did not work well?
What actions can I take to improve the software development process going
forward? It gives me pleasure to build a deeper understanding of the data
science domain and to formulate concrete next steps for present and future data
science projects.

This blog is part of my effort to document and communicate my findings and
insights. I hope readers will find these posts actionable and impactful.
